🌦️ Project: Simple Weather App

👨‍💻 I just completed a mini weather app using Flutter where:

- I fetch real-time weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API
- Get user's current city automatically using Geolocator + Geocoding
- Display clean UI with Lottie animations for different weather conditions (Rain, Cloud, Clear, Storm, etc.)
- Used API calls with http, JSON parsing, and custom model class (Weather)
- Managed async state using StatefulWidget lifecycle

📍 Key Features:
✅ Detects user’s current location automatically
✅ Fetches live temperature & condition
✅ Smooth Lottie animations for better UX
✅ Clean code structure with service layer + models

💡 What I Learned:

How to integrate public REST APIs in Flutter

How to work with GPS, Permissions, Placemark

How to use JSON decoding & factory constructors

How to add animations to make UI look modern
